        <h5>
            Few people would choose a prison as the location for a special evening out. However, Italy has launched its first restaurant to be located in a real jail. At the Ingalera Restaurant in Bollate prison, Milan, there are four prisoners working as waiters
            and five others cooking in the kitchen, headed by a professional chef and a ma√Ætre. It is a ground-breaking project, which allows prisoners to be gradually included into society. The reataurant has had great reviews: everyone says the food
            is worth going to prison for.
