                    <li>can is a modal verb. It only has a present form (which can be used with future meaning) and a past or conditional form (could). <br></li>
                    <li>For all other tenses and forms, we use be able to + infinitive</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>We use be able to + infinitive for ability and possibility, especially where there is no form of can, e.g. future, present perfect, infinitive and gerund, etc.</li>
                    <li>We sometimes use be able to in the present and past (instead of can / could), usually if we want to be more formal.</li>
