                <ul>
                    <li>We normally use thrid conditional sentences to talk about how things could have been different in the past, i.e. for hypothetical / imaginary situations. Compare: <br> Yesterday I got up late and missed my train. (= the real situation).
                        <br> If I hadn't got up late yesterday, I wouldn't have missed my train. (= the hypothetical or imaginary past situation)</li>
                    <li>To make a thrid conditional, use if + past perfect and would have + past participle.</li>
                    <li>The contraction of both had and would is 'd.</li>
                    <li>We can use might or could instead of would to make the result less certain. <br> If she's studied harder, she might have passed the exam.</li>
