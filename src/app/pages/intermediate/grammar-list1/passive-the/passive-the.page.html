                    <li>We often use the passive when it's not said, known, or important who does an action.</li>
                    <li>If you want to say who did the action, use by.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We can often say things in two ways, in the active or in the passive. Compare: <br> Batman Begins was directed by Christopher Nolan. (= the focus is more on the film). <br> Christopher Nolan directed Batman Begins in 2005. (= the
                            focus is more on Nolan).</li>
                        <li>We form negatives and questions in the same way as in active sentences. <br> Some films <strong>aren't shots</strong> on location <br>
                            <strong>Is</strong> you car <strong>being</strong> repaired today?</li>
                        <li>We often use the passive to talk about processes, for example, scientific processes, and in informal writing, such as newspaper reports.</li>
