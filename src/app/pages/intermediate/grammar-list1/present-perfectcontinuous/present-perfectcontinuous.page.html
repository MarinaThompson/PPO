                            How long <strong>have</strong> you <strong>been learning</strong> English? <br> Nick <strong>has been working</strong> here since April. <br> They
                            <strong>'ve been going out</strong> together for about three years.

                            Your eyes are red. <strong>Have</strong> you <strong>been crying?</strong> <br> No, I<strong>'ve been cutting</strong> onions.

                    <ol>
                        <li>We use the present perfect continuous with for and since with <strong>action verbs</strong> to talk about actions which started in the past and are still true now.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't use the present continuous with for/since. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>We can also use the present perfect continuous for continuous or repeated actions which have been happening very recently. The actions have usually just finished.</li>
